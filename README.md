# 3dModel-to-2dArt

 Drawing Art is a natural ability of human beings. Artists are even more well-trained on this skill. We believe that machines can be trained to have this ablity. According to the real-world drawing process, some artists create artworks based on observing the 3d physical world, i.e., all of strokes, usage of colors, textures and drawing styles are strongly related to 3d structures of the scene and lighting conditions on each object. Different from "image style transfer" which transfer a real photo into an artistic image, we studies the problem "Painterly rendering for 3d Model or 3d Scene" or "Artistic Image Generetion for 3D Models", directly generating an artistic image given a 3d object and an artwork example. 

 This is a small dataset for studying the "Painterly rendering for 3d Model or 3d Scene" problem, focusing on automatically create different styles, textures and strokes based on different lighting conditions on 3d models.

## Dataset Introduction 

* The source file (.max) of 3D Models created by [Autodesk 3dMax](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview). All objects are in the same file.
* Each 3d object model, also, followed by six images which represent  Photorealistic 3D Rendering by multiple types of lighting
* Style image created by Jiayi Chen, using [CorelPainter](https://www.painterartist.com/en/product/painter/?sourceid=ptr2020-xx-ppc_brkws&x-vehicle=ppc_brkws&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInrG05eLl5AIVzw0rCh1_jwf1EAAYASAAEgK-avD_BwE).
